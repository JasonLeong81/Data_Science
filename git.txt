# A branch is a copy of a repository at a given time that has different changes.

# mkdir testrepo, cd testrepo, git init, git add <filename>, git status, git commit -m "less than 50 words",
# change something in file, git add . , git commit -m "added another file"

# git checkout -b <name of new branch>, git add . , git commit -m "added file to new branch"
# git checkout <master> # go back to master branch and see that the file is not changed
# git merge master # change something in the file in master but not in new and that change will not be in the new branch. To bring all the changes to new, we merge them.
# to resolve for merge conflicts, simply delete ===,<<<,>>> and other things that is not needed and then add and commit again.
