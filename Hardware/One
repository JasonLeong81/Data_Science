CPU -> Control Unit, ALU, Memory

Control Unit -> Controls the operations of all parts of a computer. It obtains instructions from memory and directs the operation of the computer.
It converts user input (ie from keyboard) and send them to ALU. Uses clock inputs (measured in megahertz) to maintain sequence of data.

ALU -> Carries out arithmetic (math) and logic (AND OR NOT) operations.

Memory Unit -> Stores data. AKA primary memory or RAM. Secondary memory are like ROM, Memory card and Hard disk.

Crash Course 5
An overflow is when the result of an addition is too large to be represented by the number of bits you are using.
For 8-bits ALU : inputs and outputs are 8 bits, operation code is 4 bits, and flags (ie overflow, zero, or negative) are 1 bit
